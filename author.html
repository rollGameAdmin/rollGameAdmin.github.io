        <p>About:</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hi there! My name is Josean Martinez! I'm so glad
        you've decided to check out my game. This is a project that developed throughout
        my sophomore year as a Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University.
        As I progressed through my courses I thought about ways in which I could start applying
        all of the concepts I had been learning and that's when the idea of making a game came about.
        I went through a course online reviewing the basics on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery and then
        started to put everything into action! This project took about 3-4 months to complete and I believe
        it has much potential. It also serves as my capstone for my final semester as an
        Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship scholar at Ohio State. My hope is to eventually
        work in web development throughout my professional career and to continue creating and innovating
        in everything that I do. All of the code, structure and graphics for the game were made from scratch as well, and
        in case you were wondering, I used mostly Visual Studio Code, Adobe Illustrator, and solely HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        and a little bit of JQuery. Sweet! That's a little bit about me and this project. Thanks again for the support!</p>
